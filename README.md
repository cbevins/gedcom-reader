# gedcom-reader

A collection of Javascript routines that read a GEDCOM text file from a local file system into a JSON object, which is then available to create various genealogy data sets.

There are two sections to the collection: one for Node runtime environments, and one for client-side browsers.

The first section demonstrates reading GEDCOM files within the Node runtime environment .

The second section is a Svelte app that reads local system GEDCOM file selected by the user using a browser client-side file upload.
